tasks easier. Each user will interact with the Assistant through a Chat which
offers the following features :

This makes work faster and helps everyone work together better.



## Structure of the repository

Our repository includes  a `doc` directory at the root that contains the
project's documentation. Inside it, there are **two additional directories** :

- `images` : Contains all images related to our software
- `models` : Contains all  models related to our software


A `src` directory has also been added to the root of the repository, which will
contain all the files related to the software's implementation, and a 
`.gitignore` file is created at the root to ensure `.tmp` files are ignored,
keeping the repository clean and streamlined.
